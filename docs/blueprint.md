# **App Name**: CrowdNav

## Core Features:

- Admin Zone Configuration: Admin users can define zones by specifying GPS coordinates for each zone, and initially setting zone-wise crowd density manually.
- User Location Tracking: Collects user's GPS coordinates at regular intervals (set by admin, between 30 seconds and 5 minutes), classifying zones based on user density.
- Crowd Density Classification: Classifies each zone into categories: 'over-crowded', 'crowded', 'moderate', 'free', based on real-time user location data and uses the location data as a tool to help it classify density..
- Optimal Route Generation: Generates the least crowded route from a specified source zone to a destination zone, based on an algorithm (ANT COLONY OPTIMIZATION).
- User Interface for Route Display: Displays the optimal route on a map interface, showing users the path from their current location to their destination.
- Real-time Congestion Alerts: Suggests alternative routes if the primary pathway is overly congested, utilizing ANT COLONY OPTIMIZATION and using that as a tool to classify alternative routes.
- Admin Settings Panel: Allows admins to set the frequency of location updates, manually adjust crowd density for each zone, and configure zone boundaries.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to convey trust and reliability.
- Background color: Light blue (#E3F2FD), a lighter shade of the primary hue.
- Accent color: Amber (#FFB300) for CTAs and highlighting the optimal route.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use clear, modern icons to represent different crowd levels and zones. Prefer simplified, outlined icons for a clean look.
- Employ a card-based layout for displaying zone information and route details. Keep the layout clean and intuitive to reduce cognitive load.
- Use smooth transitions and animations to indicate changes in crowd levels or route updates, ensuring the interface feels responsive.
